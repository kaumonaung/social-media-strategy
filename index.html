          <h2>Why Bother Creating a Strategy</h2>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Whether your business is active or planning to integrate social media, either way, there is no way around having a solid social media strategy at one point.</p>

      <p>If you are serious about it and aim to strive for a prosperous online long-term presence, then you better start as soon as possible.</p>

      <p><strong>But what is a social media strategy?</strong></p>

      <p><em>A social media strategy is a strategic plan for how a company will incorporate social media into its business, and thus, shouldn’t be treated like a magical black box, but like any other business related endeavors.</em></p>

      <p>A social strategy needs to align with the essential elements of your business, helping your business to accomplish your objectives. Whether be it to increase customer satisfaction, generating more sales leads, driving web traffic or
        building
        your brand out.</p>

      <p>It provides clarity, guidance, and documentation of your processes and policy to ensure optimized workflow and adherence to the best practices across your organization.</p>

      </div>

      <p>As you see above, being social on the internet has become more important than ever as social media has seen a whooping <a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2018/01/global-digital-report-2018">3.2 billion</a> users in 2018. <br>Equally
        important is your own blog, as 2018 recorded <a href="https://wearesocial.com/blog/2018/01/global-digital-report-2018">4 billion</a> internet users.</p>

      <p>Now if that's sorted out ...</p>

      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/social-media-strategy.png" alt="">

      <p>The essential parts that make a social media strategy effective and data-driven are:</p>

      <ul class="text">
        <li><a href="#foundation">Foundation</a></li>
        <li><a href="#content">Content Strategy</a></li>

      <p>Each component is broken down into several smaller parts, which will we go in more in-depth later on this post.</p>

      <p>Incorporating all of them, if possible, will give your business the best guidance possible to navigate through this promising but fragile environment.</p>

      <p>But let’s not waste any more time and dive right into it.</p>

    <!--!!!–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––!!!CHAPTER 1: FOUNDATION!!!–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––!!!-->

    <div class="block part-one">
      <div class="chapter-container">
        <h1 class="chapter-text title">Part 1:</h1>

        <h1 class="chapter-text" id="foundation">Foundation</h1>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <p class="chapter-text">The foundation has lots of different aspects incorporated, but mainly consists of:</p>

        <ul class="chapter-text">
          <li>A social media audit</li>
          <li>Goals & objectives </li>
          <li>Budget, tactics & tools</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="chapter-text">They are all important because with them you not only consider successes and opportunities on social media, but also create the strategic plan for supporting organizational goals, such as social ads, a business blog
          or the creation of an
          influencer strategy.</p>

        <p class="chapter-text">This is usually the very first thing you do when creating the strategy, as this draws information and insights from the past and present, but does not, yet, consider plans and actions for the future.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="block text">
      <div class="heading-wrapper">
        <div class="heading">
          <h2>Social Media Audit</h2>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>A social audit’s purpose is to analyze the effectiveness of your previous social media efforts, to understand your audience behavior, competitors and ongoing and passing trends and fads.</p>

      <p>By doing so, you can assess what’s working and what’s not, and steer and adjust the course accordingly for the future.</p>

      <p>You should not skip this step in creating a strategy, as this could result in an ineffective social strategy or an accidental imitation of your competitors, which could reflect negatively on your brand.</p>

      <p>Even if your business is just starting out with social media, you can still conduct a competitor analysis and assess their audience behavior and trends to gauge your strategy with more clarity and data.</p>

      <p>A social media audit involves three components:</p>

      <ol class="text">
        <li>Audience analysis </li>
        <li>Internal audit</li>
        <li>Competitive audit</li>
      </ol>

      <p>If you are just starting to implement social media, then you may skip the internal audit and audience analysis.</p>

      <p>The audience analysis looks at your current followers on social media.</p>

      <p>For example, look at your current followers to assess their demographics and identify your reached target group by asking yourself on what channels your audience is on and how you can tailor
        your approach to reach them.</p>

      <p>However, you can still do that even if you are starting out, by doing the same thing with your competitors. You may not gather as much information, but it’s indefinitely better than doing no research prior to building up a strategy.</p>

      <p>An internal audit tries to contextualize your past progress by looking back at your numbers and analyzing your improvements. It lists your social properties, posting frequency, follower counts, engagement rates and referral traffic to your
        website.</p>

      <p>All these metrics are then recorded on a spreadsheet for each month of your previous year to track your progess.</p>

      <p>A competitor analysis looks at your competitor's basic metrics and share of voice (SOV). Your goal here is to learn from your competitors' successes and failures. For example by asking what content of theirs outperformed your own.</p>

      <p>Finally, you wrap up the audit with a summary of your findings. A SWOT analysis is one way to do it.</p>

      <p>Remember though, the overall key question you want to answer is: “What value is your company adding to your customers through social now vs. the value you want to be adding?”</p>

      <div class="heading-wrapper">
        <div class="heading">
          <h2>Goals & Objectives</h2>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>This part should be clear. You want to make sure that your time and effort devoted to social marketing on behalf of your organization are designed to clearly contribute to your larger business objectives.</p>

      <p>It’s important to calibrate your social marketing plans with your available resources. A good rule of thumb is to use the SMART (Specific Measurable Achievable Resourced Time-Bound) framework to guide your creation of social media
        objectives.</p>

      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/goals.png" alt="">
      </div>

      <p>You wanna start with larger objectives first and then narrow it down to some metrics that are best suited to report the progress and efficiency of the strategy, i.e. creating KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).</p>

      <p>Once you’ve established KPIs by choosing relevant metrics, you’ll need to settle on a target number that’s achievable, yet ambitious.</p>

      <div class="heading-wrapper">
        <div class="heading">
          <h2>Budget, Tactics & Tools</h2>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Arguably one of the most annoying part.</p>

      <p>Especially if you are working in a larger organization and have to pitch a budget to a supervisor or an executive who has not fully grasp social media, as it is often not taken seriously from businesses.</p>

      <div class="heading-wrapper">
        <div class="heading">
          <h3>Budget</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Setting a budget is much easier if you can refer to your Return on Investment (ROI) from the previous accounting year, but even if don’t have your own data to back up your decisions, there are still few things to consider and worthy to
        show.</p>

      <p>The best way to pitch a budget is to showcase the value that you hope to accomplish with social media. Coming to the table with well thought out social media goals, objectives, and supporting tactics and how they support your organization’s
        broader objectives makes pitching easier.</p>

      <p>You should also consider the price and cost of social media tactics (consider software, contracts, equipment).</p>

      <p>Showing what your competitor does and how you surpass their efforts is also helpful getting an idea on the size of the budget.</p>

      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/budget.png" alt="">
      </div>

      <p>When proposing a budget, try to request an experimentation fund, which you can use to take advantage of new trends and industry developments.</p>

      <p>Also, split up the budget by month to allocate resources efficiently. Look at the pace of your business across your fiscal year and factor in seasonalities.</p>

      <p>If possible try to work as close as you can with whoever controls the data within your company to understand customer trends that may impact where and when your budget is best spent.</p>

      <p>Factoring in larger marketing campaigns, company acquisitions, or important announcements also needs to be taken into account.</p>

      <p>And lastly, be proactive throughout the year and look at new social trends and opportunities for improvement, and shift resources accordingly around.</p>

      <div class="heading-wrapper">
        <div class="heading">
          <h3>Tactics & Tools</h3>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>By now, you should have social media objectives and your budget projections, now it's time to think tactically.</p>

      <p>Social media tactics and the tools that support them, are the workhorses of a social strategy – the nuts and bolts behind a social
        marketing success.</p>

      <p>Social media tactics can be grouped into three buckets (most marketers use all of them to achieve social media tactic goals):</p>

      <ul class="text">
        <li>Owned</li>
        <li>Earned</li>
        <li>Paid</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I will not get into detail, but here is the gist of all of them.</p>

      <p>Owned tactics refer to serving messages and content organically through your organization’s official social channels. Examples include your blog, your Facebook, Twitter or Instagram account.</p>

      <p>Earned tactics involve community engagement. For example spurring positive online conversations about your organization, by gaining the voluntary support of influencers, advocates, journalists and employees to boost awareness on social
        channels.</p>

      <p>Paid tactics include spending money to get social messaging and content in front of a targeted audience, using, for example, social ads, boosted posts or paid influencers.</p>

      <p>There are many different tools out there in the market that can support each tactic.</p>

      <p>You can use the tools that come natively from your social media channels, but many of them lack automation and a centralized hub where you can control several social channels.</p>

      <p>Here are some of the third party vendor’s tool (some work for only one channel, some for many):</p>

    <div class="block part-two">

      <div class="chapter-container">
        <h1 class="chapter-text title">Part 2:</h1>

        <h1 class="chapter-text" id="Content">Content Strategy</h1>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>The content strategy is all about which type and style of content you want to distribute on your channels.</p>

        <p>For each of your social channels, you need to create a content strategy specifically. However, the broader strategy should be defined first, as all of your channels have to adhere to it.</p>

        <p>Here is what the content strategy should have:</p>

        <ul class="chapter-text">
          <li>Timing and Key Dates</li>
          <li>Brand Persona and Voice</li>
          <li>Content Game Plan</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="block text">

      <div class="heading-wrapper">
        <div class="heading">
          <h2>Timing and Key Dates</h2>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>You need to identify and define key dates since you want to make sure you have enough time for seasons and holidays that matter most to your business.</p>

      <p>When designing timing and key dates, keep the following in mind:</p>

      <ul class="text-normal">
        <li>Set the period of time when you’ll be developing your content</li>
        <li>The dates you will be releasing the content</li>
        <li>And the overall duration of the campaign</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Other timing factors that you need to include are the reporting intervals (monthly, quarterly or a semi-annual basis) and your company’s internal events that need social media amplification.</p>

      <div class="heading-wrapper">
        <div class="heading">
          <h2>Brand Persona and Voice</h2>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>A brand persona and voice is your brand's face & personality. It’s important because you want to maintain consistency in all your channels.</p>

      <p>Check with the marketing department to see if they have a document that defines your brand voice, and if not, then it's a good time to define one, especially larger organizations should follow this, as larger businesses have a higher chance
        to become inconsistent in their presentation.</p>

      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/brand-persona-voice.png" alt="">
      </div>

      <p>Ask questions like: Is your brand friendly or provocative? Fun or serious? Formal or casual?</p>

      <p>If you don’t have a brand strategy, then start by listing adjectives that you want your audience to describe to you and then incorporate that in the brand strategy.</p>


      <div class="heading-wrapper">
        <div class="heading">
          <h2>Content Game Plan</h2>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Putting a content game plan is the bread and butter of the social media strategy plan.</p>

      <p>Essentially, you want to determine whom you’re communicating with and what you want to achieve with your content, as well as, the ways to effectively distribute it to your audience.</p>

      <p>The key elements of a good content plan are:</p>

      <ul class="text">
        <li>Target audience</li>
        <li>Goals</li>
        <li>Brand voice</li>
        <li>Distribution channels</li>
        <li>Tactics</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Keep in mind that content can be repurposed from one channel to the next. For example, a photo essay from your blog may be divided into multiple posts on Instagram and Facebook.</p>

      <p>Creatively repurposing your content will maximize your resources and will help keep your message consistent, also known as a "content pyramid".</p>

      <p>When you develop a content strategy, then there are some important questions to consider:</p>

      <ul class="text-normal">
        <li>Who will create the content?</li>
        <li>On which channel do you want to distribute it?</li>
        <li>And how often?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For questions like this, a content calendar is a great tool to keep this information organized and to visualize your plan.</p>

    <!--!!!–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––!!!CHAPTER 3: SOCIAL MEDIA CRISIS!!!–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––!!!-->

    <div class="block part-three">
      <div class="chapter-container">
        <h1 class="chapter-text title">Part 3:</h1>

        <h1 class="chapter-text" id="crisis">Social Media Crisis</h1>

        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>Often overlooked and not pleasant to talk about, a crisis management plan is crucial. Do not skip this. It’s of utmost importance for a prosperous future.</p>

        <p>It consists of the following components:</p>

        <ul class="chapter-text">
          <li>Roles & Responsibilities of your Social Team</li>
          <li>A Social Media Governance Plan</li>
          <li>And a Crisis Management Plan</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="block text">
      <div class="heading-wrapper">
        <div class="heading">
          <h2>Roles & Responsibilities of your Social Team</h2>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>First, look at who has access on your social media channels, including any third-party apps through which you granted access.</p>

      <p>A good best practice is to only grant access to a few people of your social media channels.</p>

      <p>Consider changing the password if there are too many having access to it, and share it only to people executing the social media strategy.</p>

      <p>There are 4 distinct key roles you need to determine:</p>

      <ul class="text-normal">
        <li>Social Media Director</li>
        <li>Social Media Manager</li>
        <li>Social Media Coordinator</li>
        <li>Social Media Content Creator</li>
      </ul>

      <p><i>Note: in smaller companies, one person may perform the responsibility of all these roles.</i></p>

      <p>A “Social Media Director” is responsible for higher level planning and has the final say over social media budgets, campaigns, and strategies.</p>

      <p>The “Social Media Manager” plans and oversees day-to-day execution. They also manage campaigns to ensure all elements are running smoothly and are deployed on time.</p>

      <p>“Social Media Coordinator” concerns with publishing contents, monitoring engagement and responding to questions and comments.</p>

      <p>In this case, one person can be assigned per network / social channel.</p>

      <p>The “Social Media Content Creator” is responsible for creating content or prepare existing content like blog posts for social media.</p>

      <p>The content creator part can easily outsourced if needed. For example, invite other bloggers or jorunalist to post a guest blog (known as guesst blogging).</p>

      <div class="heading-wrapper">
        <div class="heading">
          <h2>Social Media Governance Plan</h2>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Social media governance is a collection of policy documents, that organizations create with the purpose of ensuring employees’ professional and personal social media activities reflect organizational values and best practices.</p>

      <p>If you don’t do this, then the lack of social media governance could result in:</p>

      <ul class="text-normal">
        <li>Misuse or unauthorized use of company profiles credentials</li>
        <li>Inappropriate employee conduct on social media</li>
        <li>Out of date or inaccurate social media education within your organization</li>
      </ul>

      <p>All of which can open up to legal risks, brand damage and lost revenue, which no business wants to have.</p>

      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img src="images/social-media-governance.png" alt="">
      </div>

      <p>Again, here is only a basic blueprint of social media governance:</p>

      <ol class="text">
        <li>Scope</li>
        <li>Creating & Updating Documentation</li>
        <li>Approvals</li>
        <li>Social Media Policy</li>
        <li>Education & Training</li>
      </ol>

      <p>The scope covers what your governance plan applies to.</p>

      <p>The second point outlines the process of creating and updating governance documentation.</p>

      <p>Approvals refer to the approval process of content that will be published on your channels.</p>

      <p>A social media policy is the largest component, which protects a brand’s integrity and reputation by outlining appropriate and inappropriate uses of social media by employees – personally and professionally.</p>

      <p>Education and training are exactly what it suggests. Employees can be your best brand ambassadors, so think hard how you can best educate about your organization’s social media policies and procedures.</p>

      <p>Make sure, if you created a governance plan, it is observed by employees regularly or else it is not effective.</p>

      <div class="heading-wrapper">
        <div class="heading">
          <h2>Crisis Management Plan</h2>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>A crisis management plan details the proper steps to take should a critical situation arise.<br>In more detail:</p>

      <ul class="text-normal">
        <li>Prepare in advance for possible issues and crisis</li>
        <li>Mitigate risks</li>
        <li>Increase the likelihood of a positive outcome</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The parts of a crisis management plan include:</p>

      <ol class="text">
        <li>Social Media Monitoring strategy</li>
        <li>List of decision makers</li>
        <li>Decision Tree</li>
      </ol>

      <p>A social media monitoring strategy is perhaps the most important part, as it focues on preventing critical issues.</p>

      <p>Is vital to identify and respond to external issues and crisis on social media before they spiral out of control.</p>

      <p>In this part, you define all terms, names, and hashtags that you need to monitor for your organization.</p>

      <p>It’s also a best practice to arm yourself with pre-approved messages to address potential internal and external issues.</p>

      <p>The list of decision makers is a list of people who are responsible for each channel they manage, including their needed contact information. This comes handy if you want to reach them outside business hours if a crisis occurs.</p>

      <p>The decision tree defines the process that should unfold once an issue or crisis is identified. The best way to understand and practice is to run your social team through a crisis simulation.</p>

      <p>It will help them approach an actual crisis calmly and familiarize them with the actual procedures required should a situation arise.</p>
